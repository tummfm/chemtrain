Models
------

**Chemtrain** does not require a specific model to be used.
Nevertheless, it provides some pre-defined models, such as a simple classical
force field in the :mod:`chemtrain.models.prior` module.

Building Blocks
-----------------

These submodules contain utilities necessary for building advanced potential
models. For example, the :mod:`chemtrain.models.sparse_graph` module contains
functions to construct a sparse graph from a JAX, M.D
:class:`jax_md.partition.NeighborList`.
